### My Portfolio
#### MPOP Reverse II (Ryann Kim Sesgundo)

---
### Introduction
> This is just my personal portfolio, which I've started few months ago. The repository was all made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As I want to practice more about web designing, I've created this repository. For more, kindly visit facebook.com/MPOP.ph or check out my other account facebook.com/kyrios.afxisi. For the layout and design: [Kindly visit this figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/SkkloHl7FTAHUUrJdes4Mt/portfolio?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=t5gSEk33pexBmb9s-0)

### Code Inspiration
> As being a so-called programmer, I want to explore the different layout and UI in making not just Portfolio, but also in other types of design.
As how I construct the code, and added different comments, I want to share what I gain since 2016 when I started the basics of HTML. By building with
different stack, frameworks and libraries. The main idea of the current design of the portfolio came from [`Richard Hanrick`](https://codewithsadee.github.io/vcard-personal-portfolio/).
As I was inspired with his portfolio, I tried to create almost same as his design, but still plugged with different so that I may able to add some originality
thou I copied the concept the portfolio or what he called `vcard`, I still added him in the credits as the owner of the current design used.
