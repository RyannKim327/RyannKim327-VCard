### Introduction
> So from my nth version of portfolio which build with `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, I've decided to use `ReactJs` and `TailwindCSS` for the front-end.
This is just to adopt the current and latest technologies, and to practice migrations for me to enhance my skills in programming and critical thinking.

---
### Inspiration
> This portfolio was originally idea from `Sir Richard Henrick`, which I don't claim as mine. This was just professional looking, as well as complete
design practice for some web designs based on my taste and experience.

### Project Initiation
1. To initiate the react app, kindly install `npx` using `npm install npx -g`. These command may only used once, and once you want to create another new project it is not required.
2. Execute the create react app using `npx create-react-app <project_name>` where the project name is your project you want example is `npx create-react-app my_app`.
3. Once you installed those things, you may now start your project, just go to the project directory, and run `npm start` for you to see how to start
4. To close the program, kindly use `CTRL+c` to terminate the process.

---
### Github deployment
1. Install gh-pages using `npm install --save-dev gh-pages`
2. Edit `homepage` from your `package.json` like this example
```JSON
"homepage": "https://<github_username>.github.io/"
```
3. Add these scripts in your `package.json` under script key
```JSON
"scripts": {
  ...,
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
```
4. Execute to your terminal `npm run build`
5. Push to your github
6. Deploy with Github Pages `npm run deploy`
7. Go to your repository settings, go to `Pages`, and choose gh-pages into the `Branch` section
8. If you have your custom domain, kindly modify the value of `deploy` under `scripts` with this format `gh-pages -d build --cname <yourdomain>`, it looks like this.
```JSON
"scripts": {
  ...,
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build --cname mydomain.com"
}

```

### Additionals
> If ever you want to deploy your react app to your github, it was default to have two branches, the `main` or `master` and the `gh-pages`.
