### Introduction
> So from my nth version of portfolio which build with `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, I've decided to use `ReactJs` and `TailwindCSS` for the front-end.
This is just to adopt the current and latest technologies, and to practice migrations for me to enhance my skills in programming and critical thinking.

---
### Inspiration
> This portfolio was originally idea from `Sir Richard Henrick`, which I don't claim as mine. This was just professional looking, as well as complete
design practice for some web designs based on my taste and experience.
